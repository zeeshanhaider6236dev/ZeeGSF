                    Go to the checkout and pay here. You will then be taken to a new form that takes you through the steps of giving us access to the right platforms (Google Analytics, Google Merchant Center). The form will also ask you more questions about your suspension that will help us find the likely cause of your suspension. Please answer these questions the best you can. It gives us a big head start and we’ll have a much better chance of finding the cause if you fill them out well. Once complete, we’ll start the audit which generally takes 7 days (but we’ll do what we can to get it done before then). Keep in mind that there’s a lot of things that we check in our audit. We’re basically checking your entire website, GMC account and feed! You will receive an email from our team once the audit is complete. You will receive the audit as a PDF report attached to that email.

We've helped other stores get unsuspended but we can't guarantee that we'll find the exact cause of your suspension. Suspensions are entirely up to Google's discretion and you will still need to put in the work to communicate with Google which involves emails and potentially, calls.

                    Our audits will currently take 7 days to complete. We spend a lot of time on our audits as there’s a lot of things to check on all platforms. We’ll do our best to deliver it as soon as possible.

                    Yes, we contact them via email as well as the support chat. We’ll include our findings in the audit. Sometimes Google will provide us with valuable information to assist but in many cases we’ll also receive canned responses.

                    No. To keep the cost of this audit service low, you will need to make the changes to your site on your own. We will provide the recommendations but you will need to adjust your pages depending on how you sell your own products. For example, we will advise what changes or extra information you will need to add to your Returns & Refunds page but the exact words you add will vary depending on your actual policy. Every store will have their own Returns & Refunds policy so you will just add the specific information that’s relevant for your own store. We will tell you what you will need to adjust to be in line with Google’s policies and best practices.

                    Yes. We've had some clients receive those ‘permanently suspended' emails before and still been able to lift the suspension. You'll need to fix every problem on your site and in your GMC account first. You will then need to contact Google to proceed with the review but make sure your site is spotless and everything is fixed.

                    No, we don't provide special discounts on our products or services. This audit service takes a considerable amount of our team's time to conduct. If it's outside your budget then we recommend you check out our GMC Suspension Guide here. This includes a full walkthrough and checklist you can apply to your own store to find the likely cause of the suspension and get it lifted.
