            <Typography>
              Here are some of the steps which will help you improve your product performance for Google Shopping for shopify
              You can click on a product and see why you have a bad score. Once you do that you will be able to see the different places where you can improve your score, for example:
            </Typography>
            <ul>
              <li>Title</li>
              <li>Description</li>
              <li>Google Products Category</li>
              <li>Product Type  </li>
              <li>Brand</li>
              <li>GTIN</li>
              <li>Promotion Ids</li>
              <li>Images</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Out of all these attributes, "Title" and "Description" play a significant role in improving the score as well as the performance of shopping ads, so adding a proper title and description is highly recommended.
              Changing the title in the feed app will not change the title provided on the website. So, you have titles optimized for conversions on the website and optimized for keywords in Merchant center.
